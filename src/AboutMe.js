        <h2>About Nico Cobb</h2>
        <p>I am a Software developer who has been 
            in the industry for about two years. 
            In my own time, I work on game projects primarily
            and recently have been venturing out further into various
            branches of software development.
            In my own time I have worked on AWS based projects, am currently working on
            a custom game engine, and various multi-discipline projects
            in my games. I have worked on the Godot engine, gaining experience
            working in FOSS Systems.

            In my professional career, I have worked primarily in web based
            projects. These have been built using React and Angular webstacks.
            I have worked on team sizes ranging from three developers up to ten.
